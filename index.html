        <p class="wiki">The term salaryman (サラリーマン, sararīman) refers to any salaried worker. 
            In Japanese popular culture, this is embodied by a white-collar worker who shows overriding 
            loyalty and commitment to the corporation where he works.
            <br><br>Salaryman are expected to work long hours, to put in additional overtime, to participate in 
            after-work leisure activities such as drinking, singing karaoke and visiting hostess bars with 
            colleagues, and to value work over all else. The salaryman typically enters a company after graduating 
            from college and stays with that corporation for the duration of his career.</p>
